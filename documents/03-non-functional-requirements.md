# support-escalation-hub — Non-Functional Requirements

> **Important.** Performance, availability and security targets below are
> **placeholders**, not measurements. No load test, profiling run, or audit was
> performed. Every value marked `[TO BE MEASURED]` must be replaced with a real
> number before this document is used to make a performance or security claim.

## How to fill these in

1. Run a load test (k6, Artillery, or Locust) against a staging deployment.
2. Profile cold-start and hot-path latency with the framework's own tooling.
3. Record results in the table below alongside the date and commit SHA.
